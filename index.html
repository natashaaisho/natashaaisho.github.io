									<h3>About Me</h3>
									<p>
										Born in Alberta, grew up in Ontario, the only thing Natasha wanted to be was an actor. 
										She was always putting on performances at home, and whenever she could, got sent off to 
										theatre and band camps alike. She has 8 years of theatre school under her belt, 4 at a 
										Performing Arts High School for Drama and a 4 year BFA Acting Degree from the 
										University of Windsor. Soon after graduating she moved to Vancouver, 
										to give the west coast lifestyle a try.
										<br /><br />
										Since then, she has study with some of the best Vancouver has to offer like, Lori Triolo, 
										Veena Sood, and Karen Holness. Continuing to evolve and grow as an actor, is very important to 
										Natasha which means continuing to take classes and to surround herself with industry 
										professionals.
										<br /><br />
										After so many back to back years of training, Natasha took some time off and spent time in the 
										“real world” and got a “real job”. And in her own words “Really what I got is life experience, 
										the good, the bad and the ugly (see my blog for more details). It also reaffirmed 
										my dream of becoming an actor. When I jumped back in I was so happy to see that my training 
										was still there, but now coupled with my own personal experience, allowed be to be 
										more open and grounded on camera. It was an incredible difference. Taking time off might not 
										be the best option for everyone, but it was the best option for me. Now I am back in with a 
										stronger focus and commitment to my craft, than I had before.”
										Natasha also has a long hair mini dachshund Mo, who periodically takes over her instagram, 
										and always takes over her life.
